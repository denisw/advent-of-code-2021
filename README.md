# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/)
challenges, written in Python.

Each day's puzzle is in a separate Python module that can be directly
executed without any external dependencies. For instance, run the solution
for day 1:

```sh
python3 day01.py
```
